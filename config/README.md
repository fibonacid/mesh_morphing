The file settings.json is used to set some parameters that should be persistent through an entire session of the program.
Here is a list of the available parameters and their possible values:

- **fullscreen**:   Whether the sketch should be screen wide or not

- **width**:        Length in pixels of the window width

- **height**:       Length in pixels of the window height

- **eco**:          Whether the sketch should save power or not.
                    If it's set to true sketch will use fewer resources
