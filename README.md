# Mesh Morphing
A simple sketch I made to find strategies for better code development in the Processing environment.

## Introduction
As all coders do I often find myself struggling with code management, that is particularly true with Processing which is a great tool but not very suitable for big projects. This happens because Processing puts experimentation and learning at its core, and that's probably why many people started coding with it, me included. But as I became more experienced i wanted to transition from writing simple sketches to building more robust applications.  
So i decided to drop the Processing IDE for Eclipse and i looked into ways to implement an MVC design pattern (Model View Controller), one where it is applied separation of concerns between the data, its control and its presentation.
That worked alright, but I didn't find myself particularly happy with the overall experience.
Around that time i came to know web frameworks such as Ruby On Rails, ReactJS and NodeJS, and i was fascinated by the elegant solutions it provided to create more structured and at the same time enjoyable coding environment. So after a long break i found myself working with Processing again and decided to find my own "*The Rails Way*" of creating Processing applications.
I'm not here to say I made something particularly intelligent or beautiful or event useful, but to formulate my own *best practices*.

**So here is what i have done**

## Requirements
- Processing 3.x
- Processing Sound
- PeasyCam
- ControlP5

## Installation
Open a terminal and cd into the path you want this sketch to be located.
```
 cd your-path-of-choice
 git clone https://github.com/lorenzorivosecchi/mesh_morphing.git
```
Make sure you have installed all the libraries listed above, if you don't just add them using the Contribution Manager.

## Usage
Launch sketch by double clicking any `.pde" file in the directory.  
Use the graphic user interface to change some parameters of the scene.
